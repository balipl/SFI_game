# SFI Game

Simple game in Unity developed during SFI - Studencki Festiwal Informatyczny.

## What is it?

It is really simple game which task was to teach the basics of using Unity. Main scene of this game is simple clone of "Demolition Complany" where you place all of your explosives and after a few seconds all of them blow up and knock down the construction. The lower all elements of the structure stop, the higher the score is.
